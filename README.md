# MyReads Project

This application is a book tracking app for readers to keep track of the books they are currently reading, want to read, and have read in the past.

Users can search different books and add them to each category as they see fit!

To start the app, go to the project folder in your terminal then run npm install and npm start. The app will open in your browser to localhost:3000

Happy reading!
